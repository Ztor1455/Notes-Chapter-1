# 1.1-1.3 What is information technology? 

Cloud Computing is subset of information technology (IT) that utilizes all of the same terms as it relates to governance, operations, software, hardware, and infrastructure as traditional technology. 

Quote "It can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, OutSpace, and out deliver competitors. " By Edwin Kiledjian Chief Info Security Officer
	
   • IT specialist will be working on Data overload, mobile and wireless usages, cloud services, bandwidth for video. 
	
   • Hardware is all physical aspects pf an IT system as well as component installed within a computer and outside. Physically touchable and able to manipulate. 
Software is not physical but encompasses all data, application code, and programs stored digitally. Data stored on a hardware device that you can access to complete a task. 

# 1.4: The Four Pillars of an IT Framework 
   
   • Primary "ingredients" for a functioning business system are : Infrastructure, Development, Security, & Data. 
   
   • Infrastructure: is the physical components consisting of a computer and networking hardware & facilities but doesn’t exclude some software and network components. 
	
   • Development: process of writing and maintaining source code for software applications or frameworks. Software falls under "Development."	
	   ○ Software Development Life Cycle - conceptualizing software, defining requirements, designing, programming, documenting functionality, testing, & bug fixing. 
	
   • Security: set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to a company's assets. This has increased past firewalls and antiviruses into a shift in prevention. Hardware and Software fall under Security. 

Data: represented by quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed. As companies grow in data sophistication, the need for management and analyzation increases. Both Hardware & Software fall under Data. 

# 1.5: Common Terminology 
Cloud Computing was born from traditional IT concepts and it is helpful to understand terminology such as job roles and occupations in IT, computer concepts, and areas of IT. 

# 1.6
"Employment of Computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 202, much faster than the average for all occupations." 

This is one of the reason why I am getting into the tech field because of the unmatched possibilities for what's to become and achieve. 
# 1.7

"If you have never built or looked inside of a computer, it can be hard to understand concepts of cloud computing."

Great insight and I will take this serious and start to become familiar with the components of a computer and how it has advanced.
